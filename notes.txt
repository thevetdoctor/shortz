# Notes
 
 Approach
    A simple  NodeJS express serveer was setup and modularised to incorporate two endpoints, one to post URL data and retrieve shortened URL, and the other, a GET endpoint, to result in a redirect to the original URL when the shortened URL is supplied to it

 Assumptions
    A general assumption is that the user interface could be a simple html page, that can minimally express the functionality of the API on the backend

 How to
    The application can be run and tested via the CLI commands on the Makefile
    i.e. 

    To setup application, run "make"

    To run application, run "make server"

    For unit tests, run "make test"
